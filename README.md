## Overview

## Module Description


## Setup

### What module affects


### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled, etc.), mention it here. 

### Beginning with module

## Usage

Put the classes, types, and resources for customizing, configuring, and doing the fancy stuff with your module here. 

## Reference

Here, list the classes, types, providers, facts, etc contained in your module. This section should include all of the under-the-hood workings of your module so people know what the module is touching on their system but don't need to mess with things. (We are working on automating this section!)

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should consider using changelog). You may also add any additional sections you feel are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
